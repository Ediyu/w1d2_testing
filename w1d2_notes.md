# W1D2 lighthouse

* Evaluate the situation
* come up with a solution
* Implement (or attempt to implement)  a solution
* evaluate our efforts 
* GOTO step 1

### CONVERGENCE & DIVERGENCE

Plan A should be Convergence and THEN Divergence.

Convergence
* I want to build a birdhouse (I have a goal and bring everything to it; i.e. all tools)
* Be specific with all the materials and tools (very clear picture)
Divergence
  * I have a set of tools, okay what can you make? (i.e. I have bricks);
    * Build a house, fence, castle, smasher
    * counterweight on a small trebuchet that throws at windows. 
  * I am learning the techniques, start small and get bigger
    * i.e. to build a castle, start to build a small house first and then move up 
    * What can I do with these things?

### Dev Processes

* Requirements
  * Using the sum.js example 
    * 'node sum.js 10 25' -> '35'
    * 'node sum.js 10 15' -> '25'
    * 'node sum.js -5 25' -> '20'
    * 'node sum.js asdf 25' -> '35'
      * if the requirements are not met, give an error log or message
    * 'node sum.js -5' -> 'missing an argument'
    * 'node sum.js -5 10 25' -> 'what should be the argument?'
      * Various opinions : 'too many arguments' 'add all it up' 'show solutions for each section'
  * I am making something that does something
  * Think about ALL the arugments and possibilities that can happen (bug testing)

* Plan
  * plan the steps in details step by step
    * if steps are not known, plan to study about this. 
    * create a dummy file to test the small things; experiment and get the real hang of it
    * check frequently to make sure there are no bugs
* Execute
* Debug
* Refactor
